# Questions
* How can I make application more dynamic and database would be a better solution
* Which database between mysql and h2, decided to use h2 for its simplicity
* Wanted to run a script at the start of the application so that there is already some data present.
* Should I make holiday and rates as a separate table? and decided it should be separate so that in future needed the application could be updated with new dates.
* User can already update rates and add new rates and even new cities to the application

# What I would do more
* I would add a authentication layer so that only the designated user could see and update things according to the permission
